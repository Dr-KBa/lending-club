# Unsupervised Learning & Hyperparameter Tuning
This project (Project_M3S2) is composed of the following notebooks:
-Part 1 - accept reject preparation;
-Part 2 - model streamlit deploy;
-Part 3 - Data prep grade int_rate;
-Part 4 - Prediction of grade int_rate-final;

Ant two additional files of web access and interaction with the model:
app.py
requirements.txt

# Data acquisition
The dataset was provided in Turing College website (unknown licence info)


# The notebooks
The notebooks include data preparation, exploratory analysis, and prediction model training parts.

# Model deployment and web interface
Model to classify applications as accepted/rejected is deployed as a streamlit app. Backend is running at GitHub Codespaces. And is accessible via: https://fluffy-telegram-jj567x6jqv7v2p779-8501.app.github.dev/
It may not be accessible at all times to conserve resources!

Models predicting grade and interest rate are not included in the notebooks (their metrics) as at the time of submitting they are still running. Models will be demonstrated at the demo time.

# Contribution
The analysis and most of the coding was done by Kazimieras Badokas.

ChatGPT and GitHub co-pilot was prompted to generate some complex functions or workarounds also to help with domain knowledge and web interface. Major help and explanations are highlithed and dislosed in the text throughout the code to avoid plagiarism.

Dall-E3 was prompted to generate cover image for the notebook.
